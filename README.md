## Simple Greeting Program  

This is a basic Python program that prompts the user to say **"hello"** (or anything else). It then processes the input by:  

âœ… Removing extra spaces  
âœ… Converting it to lowercase  
âœ… Printing it back to the user  

### **How to Use**  
1. Run the program:  
   python hello.py
2. Type anything when prompted.  
3. The program will display your input in lowercase.  

### **Example Usage**  
**Input:**  
```  
Say hello :P Hey There!  
```  
**Output:**  
```  
hey there!  
```  

A fun little script to test input handling! ðŸ˜†
